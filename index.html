  Abstract                 = {In this chapter we describe a general methodology for developing high-order well-balanced schemes for hyperbolic system with nonconservative products and/or source terms. We briefly recall the Dal Maso–LeFloch–Murat theory to define weak solutions of nonconservative systems and how it has been used to establish the notion of path-conservative schemes. We show that, under this framework, it is possible to extend to the nonconservative case many well-known numerical schemes that are commonly used for system of conservation laws. Moreover, their extension to high order can be done as well. Next the well-balanced property of the proposed methods is analyzed with an illustrative 1d example. Finally, we point out the difficulties related to the right definition of weak solution and the design of numerical schemes converging to them.},

  Abstract                 = {Approximate Riemann solvers ({ARS)} and polynomial viscosity matrix ({PVM)} methods constitute two general frameworks to derive numerical schemes for hyperbolic systems of Partial Differential Equations ({PDE's).} In this work, the relation between these two frameworks is analyzed: we show that every {PVM} method can be interpreted in terms of an approximate Riemann solver provided that it is based on a polynomial that interpolates the absolute value function at some points. Furthermore, the converse is true provided that the {ARS} satisfies a technical property to be specified. Besides its theoretical interest, this relation provides a useful tool to investigate the properties of some well-known numerical methods that are particular cases of {PVM} methods, as the analysis of some properties is easier for {ARS} methods. We illustrate this usefulness by analyzing the positivity-preservation property of some well-known numerical methods for the shallow water system. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  Abstract                 = {This work considers the flow of a fluid containing one disperse substance consisting of small particles that belong to different species differing in size and density. The flow is modelled by combining a multilayer shallow water approach with a polydisperse sedimentation process. This technique allows one to keep information on the vertical distribution of the solid particles in the mixture, and thereby to model the segregation of the particle species from each other, and from the fluid, taking place in the vertical direction of the gravity body force only. This polydisperse sedimentation process is described by the well-known Masliyah-Lockett-Bassoon (MLB) velocity functions. The resulting multilayer sedimentation-flow model can be written as a hyperbolic system with nonconservative products. The definitions of the nonconservative products are related to the hydrostatic pressure and to the mass and momentum hydrodynamic transfer terms between the layers. For the numerical discretization a strategy of two steps is proposed, where the first one is also divided into two parts. In the first step, instead of approximating the complete model, we approximate a reduced model with a smaller number of unknowns. Then, taking advantage of the fact that the concentrations are passive scalars in the system, we approximate the concentrations of the different species by an upwind scheme related to the numerical flux of the total concentration. In the second step, the effect of the transference terms defined in terms of the MLB model is introduced. These transfer terms are approximated by using a numerical flux function used to discretize the 1D vertical polydisperse model, see B{\"u}rger et al. [ R. B{\"u}rger, A. Garc{\'i}a, K.H. Karlsen, J.D. Towers, A family of numerical schemes for kinematic flows with discontinuous flux, J. Eng. Math. 60 (2008) 387-425]. Finally, some numerical examples are presented. Numerical results suggest that the multilayer shallow water model could be adequate in situations where the settling takes place from a suspension that undergoes horizontal movement.},

We show that, for some bedload transport models like the well-known {Meyer-Peter} and Müller model, the system is hyperbolic and, thus, linearly stable, only under some constraint on the velocity. In practical situations, this condition is hopefully fulfilled. Numerical approximations of such system are often based on a splitting method, solving first shallow water equation on a time step and, updating afterwards the topography. It is shown that this strategy can create spurious/unphysical oscillations which are related to the study of hyperbolicity. Using an upper bound of the largest eigenvector may improve the results although the instabilities cannot be always avoided, e.g. in supercritical regions.},

  Abstract                 = {Entropy inequalities play an essential role in the election of a unique solution among all possible weak solutions for a system of conservation laws. Existence of an entropy will also allow to study the stability of numerical schemes for such equations and the main ideas can be easily extended to the more general case of quasi-linear systems. Nevertheless, developing numerical schemes that agree to this notion of entropy and at the same time grant some other "good" properties is not an easy task. Here we study the case of shallow water systems. In particular, the classical one-layer and two-layer shallow water systems and a generalized Savage-Hutter model are considered. Each particular case is studied and some schemes that agree to an entropy inequality are presented. We seek that these schemes will also satisfy properties like steady-states preservation and positiviy of water heights.},

  Abstract                 = {Sediment can be transported in several ways by the action of a river. During low transport stages, particles move by sliding and rolling over the surface of the bed. With the increase of the velocity, the sediment is entrained into suspension and travels significant distances before being deposed again. One can observe a continuous exchange between sediment at the river bed and sediment in suspension. Moreover, when the concentration of suspended sediment is elevated, the river can plunge into the ocean creating an hyperpycnal plume. All this phenomena may be modeled by means of a coupled model constituted by a hydrodynamical component, described by a Shallow water system and transport equations for sediment in suspension with erosion and deposition source terms, and a morphodynamical component, which depends on a bedload transport flux. The mathematical model proposed allows to model the phenomena previously described as well as pure bedload or suspension transport and hyperpycnal plumes. The equations are solved using path-conservative schemes described by Pares et al.},

The difficulty in this system comes from the coupling terms involving some derivatives of the unknowns that make the system nonconservative, and eventually nonhyperbolic. Due to these terms, a numerical scheme obtained by performing an arbitrary scheme to each layer, and using time-splitting or other similar techniques leads to instabilities in general. Here we use entropy inequalities in order to control the stability. We introduce a stable well-balanced time-splitting scheme for the two-layer shallow water system that satisfies a fully discrete entropy inequality. In contrast with Roe type solvers, it does not need the computation of eigenvalues, which is not simple for the two-layer shallow water system. The solver has the property to keep the water heights nonnegative, and to be able to treat vanishing values.},

A semi-discrete entropy inequality gives a simpler and less restrictive approach than a fully discrete entropy inequality and leads to the definition of less restrictive conditions for numerical schemes to satisfy. First, conditions are established in an abstract framework for simple Riemann solvers to satisfy a semi-discrete entropy inequality and then the results are applied, as a particular case, to the Suliciu system. The Suliciu relaxation system is attached to the resolution of the isentropic gas dynamics system and can also handle full gas dynamics. It allows to define a simple approximate Riemann solver for gas dynamics. Conditions have already been established for the scheme to be entropy satisfying. Our approach allows to relax the conditions established in the fully discrete case and leads to the definition of a numerical scheme for gas dynamics which satisfies a semi-discrete entropy inequality while allowing exact resolution of shocks.},
